# 3. Test connection
npm run deploy:test

# 4. Deploy to production
npm run deploy
```

## 🔧 Deployment System Features

### Self-Recovery Mechanisms
- **Lost Config Recovery**: `npm run deploy:discover`
- **Setup Wizard**: `npm run deploy:setup` 
- **Configuration Validation**: `npm run deploy:verify`
- **Connection Testing**: `npm run deploy:test`

### Bulletproof Design
- Multiple fallback configuration locations
- Comprehensive error messages with solutions
- Automatic backup system
- Git-safe (secrets never committed)
- Persistent across Claude Code sessions

### All Available Commands
```bash
npm run deploy           # Deploy to production
npm run deploy:setup     # Interactive setup wizard
npm run deploy:test      # Test FTP connection
npm run deploy:verify    # Verify setup is correct
npm run deploy:discover  # Recover lost configuration
npm run deploy:help      # Show deployment guide
npm run handoff          # Generate status report
```

## 📋 Known Configuration

### FTP Settings (Hostinger)
- **Host**: 185.212.71.198 (must use IP, not domain)
- **Port**: 21 (FTP) or 65002 (SFTP on Premium)
- **Username Format**: `u921052894.SupplySide` OR `u921052894.mediumblue-chamois-837591.hostingersite.com`
- **Remote Path**: `/public_html`

### Cache Management
After deployment, **always** clear cache in Hostinger hPanel:
1. Login to hPanel
2. Go to: **Websites → Dashboard → Cache Manager**
3. Click **"Purge All"**
4. Wait 2-5 minutes

## ⚠️ Critical Deployment Notes

### Username Format Confusion
- Two different username formats exist for this account
- `u921052894.SupplySide` connects directly to `/public_html`
- `u921052894.mediumblue-chamois-837591.hostingersite.com` has different path structure
- The deployment system handles both formats automatically

### Cache Issues
- Files upload successfully but changes don't show immediately
- This is normal Hostinger behavior - cache must be cleared manually
- Always test with cache bypass: `?v=timestamp`

### Security
- `.env` file contains FTP credentials (never commit!)
- File is in `.gitignore` for protection
- Run `npm run deploy:verify` to check security settings

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Lost .env file | `npm run deploy:discover` |
| Connection fails | `npm run deploy:test` |
| Files upload but don't show | Clear cache in hPanel |
| Setup completely broken | `npm run deploy:setup` |
| Need help | Read `DEPLOYMENT.md` |
