# üö® IMAGE DEPLOYMENT FIX - SupplySide Website

## The Problem
Images exist locally but are NOT showing on the live Hostinger site because they weren't being copied to the `/dist` folder during build.

## ‚úÖ The Solution (Already Implemented)

### Automatic Fix - Build Process Updated
Your `package.json` now includes:
```json
"build": "tsc && vite build && npm run copy-images"
```

This automatically copies all images from `/public/images/` to `/dist/images/` after every build.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x fix-images.sh

# Run the fix
./fix-images.sh

# Follow the prompts to commit and push
```

### Option 2: Manual Build & Deploy
```bash
# 1. Clean and rebuild with images
rm -rf dist
npm run build

# 2. Verify images copied
ls -la dist/images/

# 3. Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix image deployment - include all images in dist"
git push origin main
```

## üìÅ Required Folder Structure

After build, your `/dist` folder should contain:
```
dist/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].css
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/              ‚Üê THIS IS WHAT WAS MISSING

## üîç Verification Checklist

After deployment, test these URLs:

### Critical Images
- [ ] Homepage Hero: `https://supplysideflooringinstallation.com/images/hero/homepage-hero.webp`
- [ ] Vinyl Preview: `https://supplysideflooringinstallation.com/images/services/vinyl-preview.jpg`
- [ ] Laminate Preview: `https://supplysideflooringinstallation.com/images/services/laminate-preview.jpg`
- [ ] Hardwood Preview: `https://supplysideflooringinstallation.com/images/services/hardwood-preview.jpg`

### Test in Browser
1. Open your site: https://supplysideflooringinstallation.com
2. Check Developer Tools > Network tab
3. Filter by "Img"
4. Look for any 404 errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Images Still Don't Show:

#### 1. Check GitHub Actions
- Go to: https://github.com/trey1mossman-ai/SupplySide/actions
- Check if the latest deployment succeeded
- Look for any FTP upload errors

#### 2. Manual FTP Upload
If GitHub Actions failed, manually upload via FTP:
1. Connect to Hostinger FTP
2. Navigate to your public_html folder
3. Create `/images` folder if it doesn't exist
4. Upload entire `/dist/images/` contents

#### 3. Verify File Permissions
In Hostinger File Manager:
- Images folders should be: 755
- Image files should be: 644

#### 4. Clear Cache
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear Hostinger cache (if using caching)
- Clear Cloudflare cache (if using)

## üìä Image Inventory

### Total Images Required: 65+
- 1 Homepage hero
- 3 About page images
- 8 Service preview images (for cards)
- 8 Service hero backgrounds
- 48 Service gallery images (6 per service)

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Hero image exists and renamed to .webp
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Service preview images exist as .jpg (need .webp conversion)
- ‚ùå Service gallery images need to be added
- ‚ùå About page images need to be added

## üîÑ GitHub Actions Workflow

Your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` automatically:
1. Builds the project (including image copy)
2. Uploads everything in `/dist` to Hostinger via FTP
3. This includes the `/images` folder

## üí° Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always use WebP format** for better performance
2. **Optimize images** before adding (max 200KB for previews, 500KB for heroes)
3. **Test locally** with `npm run build && npm run preview`
4. **Check dist folder** before pushing to ensure images are included

## üìù Notes

- The `copy-static-files.js` script handles recursive copying of all image subfolders
- Images are referenced with absolute paths starting with `/images/`
- The build process now ALWAYS includes images in deployment
- No need to manually upload images to Hostinger anymore

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

When everything is working:
- No broken image icons on the site
- Hero background visible on homepage
- All service cards show preview images
- No 404 errors in browser console for images
- Page loads quickly with optimized images
