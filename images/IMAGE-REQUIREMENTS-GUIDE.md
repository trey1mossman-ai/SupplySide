### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive, SEO-friendly names
- Include location when relevant (e.g., vinyl-flooring-lincoln-park-chicago.jpg)
- Use hyphens, not underscores

### Alt Text Requirements
Every image must have descriptive alt text that:
- Describes what's in the image
- Includes relevant keywords naturally
- Mentions Chicago/location when applicable
- Is helpful for visually impaired users

### Performance Optimization
- Compress all images without visible quality loss
- Provide multiple sizes for responsive design
- Use lazy loading for below-fold images
- Consider CDN delivery for faster loading

## Placeholder Images Currently in Use
All current images are placeholders and should be replaced with actual photography. Priority order for replacement:

1. Homepage hero image
2. Service page hero backgrounds
3. Gallery images on each service page
4. Team/about photos
5. Testimonial author photos (optional but recommended)

## Photography Tips
- Shoot during golden hour for warm, inviting light
- Include Chicago architectural elements when possible
- Show variety of home styles (modern, traditional, luxury, family)
- Capture both wide shots and detail shots
- Ensure all installations shown are actual SupplySide work
- Get property releases for all locations photographed

## Stock Photo Alternatives
If custom photography is not immediately available, high-quality stock photos can be used temporarily, but should:
- Look authentic and not overly staged
- Represent Chicago-style homes and architecture
- Match the warm, professional brand aesthetic
- Be properly licensed for commercial use

Remember: Images are crucial for building trust and showcasing quality. Invest in professional photography that truly represents the high caliber of SupplySide's work.
