# SupplySide Flooring - Image Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Created
All necessary image directories have been created in `/public/images/`:
- `/hero` - Homepage hero images
- `/services` - Service preview cards
- `/services/[service-name]` - Individual service pages (8 subdirectories)
- `/about` - About page images

### 2. Code Updates
- **Hero Component** - Updated to use local image path `/images/hero/homepage-hero.jpg`
- **Services Data** - All 8 services updated to use local preview image paths
- **Images Data Structure** - Created `/src/data/images.ts` with comprehensive image mappings

### 3. Documentation Created
- **IMAGE-DOWNLOAD-GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive list of all Pexels URLs
- **download-images.sh** - Bash script to download all images automatically
- **IMAGE-REQUIREMENTS-GUIDE.md** - Original requirements document

## Next Steps to Complete Implementation

### 1. Download Images
**Option A: Use the bash script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Volumes/Trey's Macbook TB/SupplySide website/public/images
chmod +x download-images.sh
./download-images.sh
```

**Option B: Manual download**
- Open `/public/images/IMAGE-DOWNLOAD-GUIDE.md`
- Click each URL and save to the specified location

### 2. Optimize Images
After downloading:
1. Use TinyPNG.com or similar to compress all images
2. Ensure hero images are at least 1920x1080
3. Gallery images should be at least 800x600
4. Maintain 80-90% quality

### 3. Replace Placeholder Images
The following images are placeholders and should be replaced with actual photos:
- `/images/about/team-photo.jpg` - Replace with actual team photo
- `/images/about/matt-portrait.jpg` - Replace with actual photo of Matt Lee

### 4. Update Service Detail Component (Optional Enhancement)
To add gallery functionality to service pages, update the ServiceDetail component to import and use the serviceImages data:

```typescript
import { serviceImages } from '../../data/images';

// In the component:
const images = serviceImages[service.id];
```

Then add a gallery section to display the service-specific images.

### 5. Add LazyImage Component Usage
The ServiceCard component already uses LazyImage for performance. Consider adding this to other image implementations for better loading performance.

### 6. Test Everything
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Check that all images load correctly on:
   - Homepage (hero and service cards)
   - Each of the 8 service pages
   - About page (when created)
3. Test on mobile devices for responsive behavior
4. Check page load times with Chrome DevTools

### 7. Consider Adding
- Image alt text for better SEO and accessibility
- Loading placeholders or skeleton screens
- WebP format versions for better performance
- Responsive image sizes for different screen resolutions

## Image Path Reference

All images are now referenced from the `/public` directory:
- Homepage hero: `/images/hero/homepage-hero.jpg`
- Service previews: `/images/services/[service-name]-preview.jpg`
- Service heroes: `/images/services/[service-name]/[service-name]-hero-bg.jpg`
- Service galleries: `/images/services/[service-name]/[service-name]-gallery-[1-6].jpg`

## Troubleshooting

If images don't load:
1. Check that files exist in the correct directories
2. Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Check browser console for 404 errors
4. Ensure the dev server is running from the project root
5. Clear browser cache if needed

## Performance Tips

1. Use the LazyImage component for all below-fold images
2. Consider implementing a CDN for production
3. Enable browser caching in your web server config
4. Use appropriate image formats (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics)
5. Implement responsive images with srcset for different screen sizes
